# Web Exploits CTF

Welcome to the Web Exploits CTF! This challenge is designed to introduce you to basic web security concepts, specifically focusing on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Challenge Overview

Your goal is to find and exploit the XSS vulnerability on this page. This exercise will help you understand how XSS attacks work and how to identify them in web applications.

## Instructions

1. **Visit the CTF Page:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the [CTF page](https://your-username.github.io/web-exploits-ctf).

2. **Identify the Vulnerability:**
   - Look for input fields on the page where you can enter data. In this challenge, there's a form where you can enter your name.

3. **Exploit the XSS Vulnerability:**
   - Try entering a script in the input field to see if you can execute JavaScript code. For example, enter `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` and submit the form.
   - If an alert box pops up, you've successfully exploited the XSS vulnerability!

4. **Understand the Impact:**
   - Consider how this vulnerability could be used maliciously in a real-world scenario and think about ways to mitigate such risks.
